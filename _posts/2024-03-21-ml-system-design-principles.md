Building machine learning systems that work reliably in production requires more than just good model performance. Here are the key principles I've learned from deploying ML systems at scale.

## 1. Design for Observability

Your ML system needs comprehensive monitoring from day one:

```python
# Example monitoring setup
import mlflow
import prometheus_client

class MLModelMonitor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.prediction_counter = prometheus_client.Counter(
            'ml_predictions_total', 'Total predictions made'
        )
        self.latency_histogram = prometheus_client.Histogram(
            'ml_prediction_latency', 'Prediction latency'
        )
    
    def log_prediction(self, inputs, outputs, latency):
        self.prediction_counter.inc()
        self.latency_histogram.observe(latency)
        
        # Log to MLflow for experiment tracking
        mlflow.log_metrics({
            'prediction_latency': latency,
            'input_size': len(inputs)
        })
```

## 2. Handle Data Drift Gracefully

Data distribution changes over time. Build systems that can detect and adapt:

- **Statistical tests**: KS test, PSI for feature drift detection
- **Model performance monitoring**: Track accuracy, precision, recall over time
- **Automated retraining**: Trigger retraining when drift is detected

## 3. Implement Gradual Rollouts

Never deploy new models to 100% of traffic immediately:

1. **Shadow mode**: Run new model alongside old one, compare outputs
2. **Canary deployment**: Route small percentage of traffic to new model
3. **A/B testing**: Compare business metrics between model versions
4. **Full rollout**: Only after confirming improved performance

## 4. Plan for Failure

ML systems fail in unique ways. Be prepared:

- **Fallback models**: Always have a simpler backup model
- **Circuit breakers**: Automatically fallback when error rates spike
- **Graceful degradation**: Return default predictions when models fail

## Key Takeaways

1. **Monitoring is not optional** - Instrument everything from the start
2. **Automate everything** - Manual processes don't scale
3. **Test in production** - Staging environments never match production exactly
4. **Embrace gradual rollouts** - De-risk deployments with careful rollout strategies

Building robust ML systems takes time, but following these principles will save you from many production headaches.
